Alfred workflow for AppCleaner, v2024.06.

Requires AppCleaner (free): https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/

Usage: keyword (default: clean) + space, then the name of the app you want to remove to filter. Select it with enter and AppCleaner starts up.

Allows you to completely remove an .app and all its related files.

Activate SmartDelete in the AppCleaner settings for a more thorough removal.

Based on the AppZapper workflow by Chakrit Wichian ( https://github.com/chakrit/alfred-appzapper ). Thank you.
